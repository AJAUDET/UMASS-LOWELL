At first, many newcomers to programming may express a dislike for C++ due to its
seemingly intricate syntax and steep learning curve. Some even say that one of the things a
beginner most dislikes is managing memory manually. However, as they delve deeper into the
language, they discover the beauty of its powerful features and extensive libraries. Gradually,
what they initially dislike transforms into a profound love for the versatility and efficiency that
C++ offers. The process of conquering coding challenges and witnessing the elegance of wellcrafted C++ 
code becomes a source of genuine love and passion for these aspiring programmers.

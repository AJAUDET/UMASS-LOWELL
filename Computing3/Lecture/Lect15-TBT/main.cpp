Observation for Task 3: The copy list constructor created by the compiler changed the values that were
stored in the copyArray when values in the arrList changed. This means a shallow copy was created,
we want to have a deep copy for our constructor, the one that I have created for my code works
correctly and creats a deep copy of the two

What learned: A shallow copy ties two variables to the same memory address allowing for changes in one 
to affect the other, while a deep copy creates it's own seperate instance of the linked 
list, the memory addresses are different ie: arrList == 0x16af86ba0, copyList == 0x16af86b98

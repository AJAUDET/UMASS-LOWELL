## Identifying the region of the texture in view
    - The crop function creates a window where the new texture will be initialized, and then
        the new texture will become the base for future use because it is saved to an image
## Pointers
    - The shared pointers work by sharing the data stored in texture_ with both SpriteSheet and TextureView
## Tests
    - The tests I use are the autograder check ones
    - Inside of each test different SpriteSheets and TextureView constructors are called in order to demonstrate 
        the correct implementation

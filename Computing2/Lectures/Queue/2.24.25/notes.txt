    Queues

        insert
        service
        empty
        front
    
    Queue
            Linked List
        
        insert : O(1)
        service : O(1)
        front : O(1)
        empty : O(1)

    add to the tail of the list, remove from the head of the list

    now our linked lists need a head and tail and head ptr

    Queue
            Array
        
        insert : O(1)
        service : O(1)
        front : O(1)
        empty : O(1)

        implimenting a circular array: when we run out of space we can add back in the beginning

    Queues are an Abstract Data Type: we can implement with eitehr an array or linked list without the user knowing the difference

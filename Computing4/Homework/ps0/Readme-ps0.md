# PS0: Hello SFML
## Contact
Name: AJ Audet
Section: 204
Time to Complete: 5 Hours
## Description
This project was designed to setup the SFML library on my laptop, run the SFML Hello World driver code, and 
implement my own code with my own custom sprite and movement responses
### Features
The features for my sprite are as follows
1. The sprite is responsive to the arrow keys for movement
2. The window is responsive to the ESCAPE key, closing upon it being pressed
3. Added boundary checking for the sprite, the sprite is not allowed outside of the boundaries for the window
### Extra Feature
1. 
### Issues
Currently the project works with no errors in my implementation, the nature of the project has allowed for 
experimentation in how I am able to approach 
## Integrity
I believe that the fourth statement in the Academic Integrity Statement applies best to this class. It outlines that “Academic dishonesty is an act in which a student: Intentionally impedes or damages the academic work of others.” This statement as a whole applies to Computing IV, the discord server is a prime example of how students help each other, and intentionally sabotaging another student by giving them advice that is not correct, or in the guidelines of the project goes against collaboration between peers. If people decide to not help others when they go to them they are actively hindering the other person from learning and reaching their potential.
## Acknowledgements
1. I recieved help from youtube.com for setup of SFML for CLION, and VSCODE. 
2. To figure out how the classes work I used the SFML documentation API to figure out how Event.hpp, Sprite.hpp and Keyboard.hpp function
3. To figure out how to add a boundary for my sprites I went to the discussion board on SFML to get some ideas
on how to proceed
